Personal software developing portoflio including my projects as well as school projects 



# [Project 1: Change Maker Machine in C Language](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Change_Maker_Machine_Noel) 


Project Overview:

    User enters a value and will be stored in a variable.
    The initial amount will be reduced by 5%.
    The prgram will then convert the amount to coins (Toonies, Loonies, Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, Pennies).
    After each coin the program will display the remaining.

Language Topics:

    Use of integer and floating-point values.
    Scanf Function.
    Simple Calculations using operators and expressions (including modulus operator).
    Casting.
    Rounding using math and logic.


# [Project 2: General Well Being Log in C Language](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Well_Being_Log_Noel)

Project Overview:

    Asks the user to enter year and month (format YYYY MM).
    Checks if the user has entered values betweeen 2010 and 2021 inclusive for the year.
    Checks if the user has entered values between 1 and 12 inclusive for the month.
    Asks the user to enter morning well being rating between 0.0 and 5.0 inclusive.
    Asks the user to enter evening well being rating between 0.0 and 5.0 inclusive.
    Prints morning total rating, evening total rating, overall total rating, average morning rating, average evening rating and overall average rating.

Language Topics:

    Simple Interactive Prorgam.
    Use of Selection Constructs.
    Use of Iteration Constructs.
    Nesting Logical Code Blocks.
    Mathematical Calculations.


# [Project 3: Wish_List_Forecaster in C language](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Wish_List_Forecaster)

Project Description:

This C language program implements a simple validation on a series of user input values that are stored to arrays and later analyzed to produce a variety of summary reports. The program will ask for the user's monthly income and then ask for the price and priority of a series of items the user would like to purchase in the future. It will store this information and allow the user to view predictions on how long it will take to save enough money to purchase their wish list items.

Project Overview:

    Storing data of primitive types using arrays.
    Parallel arrays.
    Processing elements of arrays.


# [Project 4: Treasure_Bomb_Game in C Language](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Treasure_Bomb_Game) 

Project Description:

This C program creates a small game that has hidden bombs and treasure along a path of variable distance. The game requires the player to enter move location commands to reveal what is hidden at a given position along the path. The object of the game is for the player to find as many treasures as possible before running out of moves or lives. Discovering a bomb will reduce the player’s life count. Discovering a treasure will earn the player treasure points. Discovering both, a treasure with a bomb in the same location will reduce the player’s life count and earn the player treasure points (consider it a life insurance payout). Prior to playing the game, the program will prompt the user to perform some upfront configurations to the player and the game components – these settings will define how the game is played.

Project Overview:

    Structures
    Object of structure type declaration
    Accessing the members of an object of structure type
    
    
# [Project 5: Register_and_Login_System](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Register_and_Login_System)

Project Description: 

* User enters a value between 0 and 2
* 0 => exit program
* 1 => Register
* 2 => Login
* If the user enters a larger or smaller number it will require to enter a number between the given options
* If the user enters 1:
*   enters name, username, email, username, password and re-enters password (and make sure they match).
* If the user enters 2:
*   enters username and password and if they are found in the file prints "Logged In Successfully".
* If the user enters 0:
*   exit prorgram.

Project Overview:

    File Handling
    Pass-by-reference
    Modularization
    Header Files
    User-defined data types (structs)
