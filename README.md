# [Project 1: Change Maker Machine in C Language](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Change_Maker_Machine_Noel) 


Project Overview:

    User enters a value and will be stored in a variable.
    The initial amount will be reduced by 5%.
    The prgram will then convert the amount to coins (Toonies, Loonies, Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, Pennies).
    After each coin the program will display the remaining.

Language Topics:

    Use of integer and floating-point values.
    Scanf Function.
    Simple Calculations using operators and expressions (including modulus operator).
    Casting.
    Rounding using math and logic.


# [Project 2: General Well Being Log in C Language](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Well_Being_Log_Noel)

Project Overview:

    Asks the user to enter year and month (format YYYY MM).
    Checks if the user has entered values betweeen 2010 and 2021 inclusive for the year.

    Asks the user to enter morning well being rating between 0.0 and 5.0 inclusive.
    Asks the user to enter evening well being rating between 0.0 and 5.0 inclusive.
    Prints morning total rating, evening total rating, overall total rating, average morning rating, average evening rating and overall average rating.

Language Topics:

    Simple Interactive Prorgam.
    Use of Selection Constructs.
    Use of Iteration Constructs.
    Nesting Logical Code Blocks.
    Mathematical Calculations.


# [Project 3: Wish_List_Forecaster in C language](https://github.com/NoelIbruli/Wish_List_Forecaster)

Project Description:

This C language program implements a simple validation on a series of user input values that are stored to arrays and later analyzed to produce a variety of summary reports. The program will ask for the user's monthly income and then ask for the price and priority of a series of items the user would like to purchase in the future. It will store this information and allow the user to view predictions on how long it will take to save enough money to purchase their wish list items.

Project Overview:

    Storing data of primitive types using arrays.
    Parallel arrays.
    Processing elements of arrays.
